# Dark Web Bitcoin Crawling and Visualization

A full-stack system that extracts Bitcoin addresses from the dark web, analyzes blockchain transactions, and visualizes them using an interactive graph. The project is designed to assist in tracking illicit cryptocurrency transactions, making it useful for law enforcement and blockchain analysts.

# System Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](arch.png)

## 1. Crawling & Data Collection Layer

- **Dark Web Crawler**: Uses Tor, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup to scrape .onion sites and extract Bitcoin addresses.
- **Amazon SQS**: A queueing service that temporarily holds the Bitcoin addresses collected by the crawler before they are processed.
- **MongoDB**: Stores the raw crawling data, including links and extracted Bitcoin addresses.

## 2. Processing Layer

- **Listener**: Retrieves Bitcoin addresses from Amazon SQS.
- **Blockchain Transactions Scraper**: Fetches transaction history from the Bitcoin ledger for collected addresses.
- **Publisher**: Structures the scraped data and stores it in a Neo4j database, representing transactions as a graph.

## 3. Storage Layer

- **MongoDB**: Stores raw data obtained from crawling the dark web, including extracted Bitcoin addresses and metadata.
- **Neo4j AuraDB**: Graph database that efficiently stores and queries Bitcoin transactions as a connected network.

## 4. Frontend & API Layer

- **Neo4j AuraDB**: Stores transaction relationships in a graph format for efficient querying.
- **Backend (Node.js + Apollo GraphQL)**: Acts as a middleware, allowing the frontend to fetch transaction data using GraphQL queries.
- **Frontend (React + Vis.js)**: Provides an interactive interface to visualize Bitcoin transactions and their movement between addresses.

# Features

# Setup Instructions

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dark-web-crypto-tracker.git
cd dark-web-crypto-tracker
```

## Future Improvements

- Expand support for Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.  
- Integrate Machine Learning to detect suspicious transactions.  
- Implement alerts for flagged or high-risk transactions.

### The Graph Displays:

- **Nodes**: Bitcoin wallet addresses.
- **Edges**: Transactions between addresses.
